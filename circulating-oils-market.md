<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Circulating Oils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Viscosity</li><li>Low Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Circulating oils market can be primarily categorized into two types based on their viscosity: high viscosity and low viscosity. High viscosity oils are thick and have a slower flow rate, making them suitable for heavy-duty machinery and equipment that operate at high temperatures. On the other hand, low viscosity oils are thinner and flow more easily, making them ideal for light-duty machinery and equipment that require faster lubrication. Both types of circulating oils play a crucial role in ensuring smooth operation and prolonging the lifespan of industrial machinery.</p></p>
