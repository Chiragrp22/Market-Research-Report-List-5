<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wide-body Aircraft Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Turbojet Engine</li><li>Turbo Fan Engine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wide-body aircraft engine market consists of two main types of engines: turbojet engines and turbofan engines. Turbojet engines are used in older aircraft models and provide high speeds through the combustion of fuel in a series of stages. On the other hand, turbofan engines are more commonly used in modern wide-body aircraft as they offer a quieter and more fuel-efficient option by using a combination of a core engine and a fan to produce thrust. Both types play a crucial role in powering wide-body aircraft for commercial and military purposes.</p></p>
