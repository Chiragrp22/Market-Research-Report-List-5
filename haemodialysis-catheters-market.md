<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Haemodialysis Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cuffed Tunneled</li><li>Non-cuffed Tunneled</li><li>Non-tunneled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Haemodialysis catheters are used for temporary or long-term access to the bloodstream during dialysis treatment. The three main types are cuffed tunneled, non-cuffed tunneled, and non-tunneled catheters. Cuffed tunneled catheters have a cuff that helps secure them in place under the skin, reducing the risk of infection. Non-cuffed tunneled catheters do not have a cuff but are still tunneled under the skin for stability. Non-tunneled catheters are inserted directly into the vein without being tunneled under the skin.</p></p>
