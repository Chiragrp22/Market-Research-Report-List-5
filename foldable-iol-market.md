<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foldable IOL Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refractive Type</li><li>Diffraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foldable IOLs are classified into two main types - refractive and diffraction. Refractive IOLs work by focusing light on the retina to improve vision at all distances, similar to a traditional lens. On the other hand, diffraction IOLs use a unique design to split light into different focal points, improving both distance and near vision. Both types of foldable IOLs offer significant benefits in terms of convenience, safety, and effectiveness compared to traditional rigid lenses.</p></p>
