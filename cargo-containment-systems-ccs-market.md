<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cargo Containment Systems (CCS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane Type CCS</li><li>Independent Type CCS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cargo Containment Systems (CCS) are essential for containing liquefied gas cargo on ships. There are two main types of CCS available in the market: Membrane Type CCS and Independent Type CCS. Membrane Type CCS consists of a flexible membrane that is welded to the ship's hull, providing a lightweight and cost-effective solution. Independent Type CCS, on the other hand, is a more robust system that is not directly attached to the ship's hull, offering greater flexibility and protection against impacts. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safe transportation of liquefied gases.</p></p>
