<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axial Thrust Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Direction Bearings</li><li>Double-Direction Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial thrust bearings are divided into two main types: single-direction bearings and double-direction bearings. Single-direction bearings can accommodate axial loads in one direction only, while double-direction bearings can withstand axial loads in both directions. Single-direction bearings are commonly used in applications where the load acts in only one direction, while double-direction bearings are utilized in cases where the load direction can vary. Both types of bearings play a crucial role in supporting and guiding rotating machinery.</p></p>
