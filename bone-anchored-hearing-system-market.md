<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone-anchored Hearing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone-anchored hearing systems are divided into implantable and non-implantable markets. Implantable systems require a surgical procedure to place a small titanium implant into the skull, which then anchors an external sound processor. Non-implantable systems use a bone conduction transducer placed against the skull without the need for surgery. Both types of systems transmit sound vibrations through the skull to the inner ear, bypassing the middle ear to help individuals with conductive or mixed hearing loss.</p></p>
