<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUS-FNA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Core Puncture</li><li>Edge Puncture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EUS-FNA (Endoscopic Ultrasound-Fine Needle Aspiration) market includes two main types: Core Puncture and Edge Puncture. Core Puncture involves inserting a thicker needle to obtain tissue samples, which may provide more diagnostic material but require a larger puncture site. Edge Puncture, on the other hand, uses a smaller needle to obtain samples from the edge of the target lesion, resulting in a smaller puncture site but potentially less tissue obtained. These two methods offer different approaches to conducting diagnostic procedures in the EUS-FNA market.</p></p>
