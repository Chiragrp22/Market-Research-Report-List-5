<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cement Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Solid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cement foam is available in two main types: liquid and solid. Liquid cement foam is a mixture of cement, water, and foaming agent that is pumped into molds to create lightweight concrete products. Solid cement foam, on the other hand, is pre-formed foam made from cement and additives that can be easily installed on construction sites. Both types offer the advantage of reduced weight and improved thermal insulation compared to traditional concrete, making them popular choices for a variety of construction projects.</p></p>
