<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Black Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Black</li><li>Furnace Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal Black and Furnace Black are two main types in the Carbon Black market. Thermal Black is produced by decomposing natural gas or oil in a controlled environment, resulting in a high purity product suitable for demanding applications such as coatings and plastics. Furnace Black, on the other hand, is created through the incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products, leading to a lower purity product that is commonly used in the rubber industry for its reinforcing properties. Both types play a crucial role in various industries due to their unique properties and applications.</p></p>
