<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inertial Separator Dust Collectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colliding Type</li><li>Rotary Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inertial separator dust collectors come in two main types - colliding type and rotary type. Colliding type dust collectors rely on the principle of inertia to separate dust particles from the air stream by causing them to collide with a barrier. Rotary type dust collectors use centrifugal force generated by a spinning rotor to separate dust particles from the air stream. Both types are effective in removing large and heavy dust particles from industrial air streams, providing a cleaner and safer working environment.</p></p>
