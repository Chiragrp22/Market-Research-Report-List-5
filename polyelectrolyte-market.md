<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyelectrolyte Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polysalts</li><li>Polycations</li><li>Polyanions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyelectrolytes are classified into three main types: Polysalts, Polycations, and Polyanions. Polysalts are polyelectrolytes formed from both positive and negative ions, resulting in a neutral charge. Polycations are polyelectrolytes with a positive charge, commonly used for flocculation and water treatment. Polyanions, on the other hand, have a negative charge and are often utilized in industries like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Each of these types plays a crucial role in various applications where the control of ionic interactions is necessary.</p></p>
