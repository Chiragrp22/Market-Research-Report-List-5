<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MRI For Breast Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Systems</li><li>Open Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MRI for breast cancer market includes two main types of imaging systems: closed systems and open systems. Closed systems are traditional MRI machines that have a tube-shaped design where the patient lies down inside the machine. These machines offer high quality images but can be uncomfortable for claustrophobic patients. On the other hand, open systems have a more spacious design that allows patients to have a more comfortable experience during the imaging process. Both types of systems are used to detect and monitor breast cancer.</p></p>
