<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adipic Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cyclohexane Oxidation</li><li>Cyclohexene Oxidation</li><li>Phenol Hydrogenation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adipic acid is primarily produced through three main market types: cyclohexane oxidation, cyclohexene oxidation, and phenol hydrogenation. Cyclohexane oxidation involves the reaction of cyclohexane with nitric acid to produce adipic acid. Cyclohexene oxidation utilizes cyclohexene as a starting material and involves the oxidation of double bonds to form adipic acid. Phenol hydrogenation involves the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, which is then oxidized to adipic acid. These processes are essential in the production of adipic acid for various industrial applications.</p></p>
