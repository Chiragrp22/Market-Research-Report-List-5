<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Speech Synthesis Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concatenation Synthesis</li><li>Formant Synthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Speech synthesis software can be broadly categorized into two main types: Concatenation Synthesis and Formant Synthesis. Concatenation Synthesis involves piecing together pre-recorded speech units to create a seamless output, offering high quality and natural sounding results. On the other hand, Formant Synthesis uses mathematical models to generate speech sounds, allowing for more control over the output but potentially sacrificing naturalness. Both types cater to different user needs, with Concatenation Synthesis being popular for applications requiring lifelike speech, while Formant Synthesis is preferred for more precise control over speech generation.</p></p>
